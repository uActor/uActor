# Î¼Actor: Stateful Content-based In-Network Computing
Platform for running Actors on various Devices (from Microcontrollers to Edge and Cloud nodes based on Linux/Unix) in the Network.
These Actors are deployed by multiple tenants and are able to communicate using Content-based Networking.

## Project Structure

### Code
* `uActor`: Main platform library.
* `uActor-POSIX`: POSIX command-line utility that allows running the platform on a POSIX node (tested on Linux and macOS). Also contains POSIX-specific components and implementation.
* `uActor-ESP32`: ESP32 ESP-IDF project for running the system on an ESP32 microcontroller. Also contains ESP32-specific components.
* `vendor`: Third-party libraries.
* `unit_test`: GTest-based unit tests for the main library.


### Other
* `tools`: Tools that allow interacting with the platform nodes.
  * actorctl.py Upload a collection of deployments to one of the nodes (which will share it with its peers)
* `evaluation`: Configuration scripts and code files that act as examples and allow reproducing the results presented in the paper.

## Building
The POSIX application is built using CMake and Ninja --- other build tools should also work --- and the ESP32 binary is built using a CMake-based esp.idf project.

The repository contains multiple git submodules, which need to be properly initialized.

Please confer to the included Makefile.

## ESP32
The application needs to be configured before building using `idf.py menuconfig` (e.g. WiFi configuration, node_id, node_labels).
Then, it can be build using `idf.py build`.

### Dependencies
ESP-IDF --- please follow [Espressif's instruction](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/), or use the Docker container [espressif/esp](https://hub.docker.com/r/espressif/idf).

## POSIX
The application is configured using flags at runtime (except for compile-time flags such as the one enabling the testbed-tooling).
It can be build by creating and moving to the build directory, running `cmake`, and finally running `ninja`.

### Dependencies
* Cmake
* Ninja
* Boost

#### Debian / Ubuntu
```bash
apt-get install build-essential cmake ninja-build python3-pip
pip3 install conan
