# Î¼Actor: Stateful Serverless at the Edge

Platform for running actors on various devices (from microcontrollers to edge and cloud nodes based on Linux/Unix) in the network.
These actors are deployed by multiple tenants and are able to communicate using Content-based Networking.

## Project Structure

### Code
* `uActor`: Main platform library.
* `uActor-POSIX`: POSIX command-line utility that allows running the platform on a POSIX node (tested on Linux and macOS). Also contains POSIX-specific components and implementation.
* `uActor-ESP32`: ESP32 ESP-IDF project for running the system on an ESP32 microcontroller. Also contains ESP32-specific components.
* `vendor`: Third-party libraries.
* `unit_test`: GTest-based unit tests for the main library.


### Other
* `tools`: Tools that allow interacting with the platform nodes.
  * actorctl.py Upload a collection of deployments to one of the nodes (which will share it with its peers)
* `evaluation`: Configuration scripts and code files that act as examples and allow reproducing the results presented in the paper.
* `examples`: Contains examples to demonstrate uActor's core functionality as well as the interaction with important platform actors.

## Submodules

You need to download all submodules:

```bash
git submodule sync &&  git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Building
The POSIX application is built using CMake and Ninja --- other build tools should also work --- and the ESP32 binary is built using a CMake-based esp.idf project.

The repository contains multiple git submodules, which need to be properly initialized.

Please confer to the included Makefile.

## ESP32
The application needs to be configured before building using `idf.py menuconfig` (e.g. WiFi configuration, node_id, node_labels).
Then, it can be build using `idf.py build`.

### Dependencies
ESP-IDF --- please follow [Espressif's instruction](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/), or use the Docker container [espressif/esp](https://hub.docker.com/r/espressif/idf).

## POSIX
The application is configured using flags at runtime (except for compile-time flags such as the one enabling the testbed-tooling).
It can be build by creating and moving to the build directory, running `cmake`, and finally running `ninja`.

### Dependencies
* Cmake
* Ninja
* Boost

#### Debian / Ubuntu
```bash
apt-get install build-essential cmake ninja-build python3-pip
pip3 install conan
```

#### macOS
```bash
brew install cmake ninja boost
```

### Crossbuilding
Crossbuilding using cmake toolchains is supported. Prebuild toolchains can be found in the [toolchains](https://gitlab.lrz.de/cm/uactor/-/tree/master/toolchains) folder.
#### Dependencies
Debian / Ubuntu
```bash
apt-get install build-essential cmake ninja-build python3-pip
pip3 install conan
```
##### ARMv7
Debian / Ubuntu
```bash
apt-get install crossbuild-essential-armhf g++-8-arm-linux-gnueabihf
```
##### ARM64
Debian / Ubuntu
```bash
apt-get install crossbuild-essential-arm64 g++-8-aarch64-linux-gnu
```
#### Building
##### Creating a Build directory
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```
##### Configuring
###### ARMv7
```bash
cmake ../uActor-POSIX -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../toolchains/armv7_linux.cmake
```
###### ARM64
```bash
cmake ../uActor-POSIX -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../toolchains/arm64_linux.cmake
```
##### Setting a Conan Directory
The previous command can fail, if conan is unable to determine a conan directory. To resolve this issue execute this block followed by the respective cmake configure command.
```bash
mkdir ../conan
cd ..
export CONAN_USER_HOME=$PWD/conan
cd build
```
##### Building
```bash
cmake --build .
```
#### Downloading a Prebuild Binary
Prebuild binaries can be download from the CI both for [ARMv7](gitlab.lrz.de/cm/uactor/-/jobs/artifacts/master/download?job=build_armv7) and [ARM64](gitlab.lrz.de/cm/uactor/-/jobs/artifacts/master/download?job=build_arm64)
